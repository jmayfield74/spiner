# CodeNarrator - Your Code’s Storyteller

Welcome to **CodeNarrator**, a unique tool that transforms your code into living, breathing stories. Designed to work seamlessly in editors like Cursor, it digs into your codebase, Git history, and quality metrics to weave tales of creation, struggle, and triumph. It’s not just analysis—it’s your code’s saga, told with flair.

## What’s CodeNarrator For?

CodeNarrator turns the dry details of your code into something memorable and alive. It’s perfect for:
- Uncovering a file’s journey—how it started, how it grew, what it’s been through.
- Measuring quality in a way that sticks—complexity, clarity, and impact as plot points.
- Sharing code insights with your team in a fun, narrative style.
- Keeping docs fresh by nudging you to update them as the story evolves.

Think of it as a bard that sings your code’s epic—great for onboarding, debugging, or just geeking out over your project’s history.

## How to Use

Getting started is easy:
1. **Load the Core**: Grab the Spiner core (the engine behind the narration) and load it into your environment—like pasting it into Cursor’s chat or script pane.
2. **Add CodeNarrator**: Drop the `CodeNarrator` system file in after the core. You’ll see a kickstart message inviting you to tell a story.
3. **Start Talking**: Say something like “narrate my main file” or “tell the project’s tale”—it’s that simple!

No fancy config—just load it in Cursor (or your editor) and chat away. It’s built for interactive vibes where you can toss in requests and hear the tale unfold.

## What Can CodeNarrator Do?

Here’s how CodeNarrator spins your code into stories, with examples and why it’s a win for you.

### Dig Into the Code
- **What It Does**: Breaks down your code’s structure and logic to set the stage.
- **How to Use**: Try “narrate my auth.js” or “tell me about this function.”
- **Why It Helps**: Gives you the “what” behind the story—loops, calls, and all—without drowning in tech-speak.
- **Example**: “Narrate auth.js” → “In a realm of logic, auth.js stood guard, its functions weaving a web of checks…”

### Uncover the History
- **What It Does**: Pulls Git logs to reveal how your code evolved—commits, changes, battles fought.
- **How to Use**: Say “tell the history of ./src” or “narrate login’s past.”
- **Why It Helps**: Shows the “when” and “why”—who shaped it, what storms it weathered.
- **Example**: “Tell login’s past” → “Long ago, login.c emerged from a single commit, then braved a refactor storm in ‘23…”

### Measure the Vibes
- **What It Does**: Scores your code’s quality—complexity, clarity, impact—to fuel the plot.
- **How to Use**: Ask “narrate quality in ./utils” or “score my main file.”
- **Why It Helps**: Turns dry metrics into drama—high complexity becomes a “tangled foe,” clarity a “noble trait.”
- **Example**: “Narrate quality in utils.js” → “Utils.js, a maze of cunning loops, bore a complexity score of 12—yet its purpose shone clear…”

### Spin the Story
- **What It Does**: Weaves code, history, and metrics into a tale—epic, snarky, or whatever fits.
- **How to Use**: Try “narrate the project” or “tell ./src’s tale with sass.”
- **Why It Helps**: Makes code memorable and shareable—perfect for docs or team laughs.
- **Example**: “Narrate ./src with sass” → “In the wilds of ./src, files strutted their stuff—main.js flexing muscle, while config.js just sat there, bloated…”

### Keep It Alive
- **What It Does**: Nudges you to update docs as the story grows—keeps the narrative current.
- **How to Use**: Say “narrate my file and update” or just keep chatting—it’ll prompt you.
- **Why It Helps**: Stops docs from rotting—ties the tale to what’s real now.
- **Example**: “Narrate db.js” → “Db.js rose from humble queries… Hey, doc this—its latest join’s missing!”

## Why You’ll Love It

- **Makes Code Fun**: Turns lines and commits into a saga you’ll actually remember.
- **Reveals the Past**: Git history becomes a plot—see your code’s origin story.
- **Quality with Soul**: Metrics like complexity get a narrative twist, not just numbers.
- **Cursor-Ready**: Chat in the sidebar, hear the tale live—fits your flow.
- **Evolving Tales**: Nudges you to keep docs in sync as the code’s story grows.
