# CodeLens - Your Code’s Smart Sidekick

Welcome to **CodeLens**, a powerful code analysis tool that dives deep into your codebase to help you explore, debug, improve, and secure your work—all while evolving with you. Built to pair with editors like Cursor, CodeLens is like a trusty wingman for developers who want to level up their code without the hassle.

## What’s CodeLens For?

CodeLens is here to make your coding life easier and your projects sharper. Whether you’re untangling a messy codebase, hunting bugs, boosting performance, or locking down security, it’s got your back. It’s not just a static tool—it adapts to your needs, suggests fixes, and can even spin a story about your code to keep things fun. Think of it as a partner that helps you:
- Understand your code’s structure and flow.
- Squash bugs with pinpoint accuracy.
- Keep quality high and tests solid.
- Speed up slow spots and secure weak points.
- Manage dependencies like a pro.

## How to Use

Getting started is a breeze:
1. **Load the Core**: Grab the Spiner core (the engine behind CodeLens) and load it into your environment—think of it as the brain that powers the magic. In Cursor, you’d paste it into a chat or script pane.
2. **Add CodeLens**: Copy the `CodeLens` system file into the same environment, right after the core. Once loaded, you’ll see a kickstart message welcoming you to the tool.
3. **Start Chatting**: Talk to it naturally—like “analyze my auth code” or “speed up my dashboard”—and watch it go!

No fancy setup required—just load and chat. Works best in interactive editors like Cursor where you can toss in commands and see results live.

## What Can CodeLens Do?

Here’s the rundown of what CodeLens brings to the table, with examples of how to use it and why it’s a game-changer.

### Explore Your Codebase
- **What It Does**: Maps out your files, modules, and how everything connects—great for onboarding or refactoring.
- **How to Use**: Say “navigate my ./src folder” or “show me how authenticateUser flows.”
- **Why It Helps**: Instantly see your code’s big picture or dive into a function’s journey—no more guessing what calls what.
- **Example**: “Hey, navigate ./src/components” → CodeLens outlines your component structure and call hierarchy.

### Debug Like a Detective
- **What It Does**: Tracks down bugs by tracing variables and spotting error patterns, then suggests fixes.
- **How to Use**: Try “debug why userData crashes in processLogin” or “trace userId through my login function.”
- **Why It Helps**: Pinpoints the root cause fast, saving you hours of stepping through code.
- **Example**: “Debug ‘TypeError: undefined id’ in my code” → CodeLens finds a null reference and suggests a check.

### Boost Code Quality
- **What It Does**: Scans for messy patterns (like long methods), refactors them, and checks test coverage.
- **How to Use**: Ask “scan ./services for quality” or “refactor this long function.”
- **Why It Helps**: Keeps your code clean and maintainable, aiming for a 20% readability boost.
- **Example**: “Quality scan ./src/services” → CodeLens flags a nested conditional and suggests splitting it out.

### Speed Things Up
- **What It Does**: Profiles slow spots, finds bottlenecks, and applies optimizations like parallelization.
- **How to Use**: Say “profile my renderDashboard function” or “improve performance in ./src.”
- **Why It Helps**: Cuts latency (targets 30% reductions) so your app feels snappy.
- **Example**: “Perf profile renderDashboard” → CodeLens spots a heavy loop and recommends memoization.

### Lock Down Security
- **What It Does**: Scans for vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection), traces sensitive data, and hardens weak spots.
- **How to Use**: Try “secure scan ./api” or “trace creditCardInfo through my code.”
- **Why It Helps**: Keeps your app safe from threats, no PhD in security required.
- **Example**: “Secure scan ./src/api” → CodeLens finds an XSS risk and suggests output encoding.

### Tame Dependencies
- **What It Does**: Maps your imports, checks their health, and suggests lighter alternatives.
- **How to Use**: Ask “map dependencies in ./services” or “optimize my lodash usage.”
- **Why It Helps**: Cuts bloat and keeps your project lean and healthy.
- **Example**: “Dep map ./src/services” → CodeLens shows lodash is overkill and suggests a slimmer pick.

### Beef Up Tests
- **What It Does**: Analyzes test coverage, finds gaps, and generates tests for uncovered code.
- **How to Use**: Say “test coverage in ./auth” or “generate tests for validateToken.”
- **Why It Helps**: Ensures your code’s rock-solid without manual test-writing grind.
- **Example**: “Test coverage ./src/auth” → CodeLens spots a missing edge case and whips up a test.

### Add Some Flair
- **What It Does**: Wraps results in a story—like “In the land of tangled loops, a bug lurked…”
- **How to Use**: Add “as a story” to any command, like “improve renderDashboard as a story.”
- **Why It Helps**: Makes dry analysis fun and memorable, perfect for team shares or solo grins.
- **Example**: “Perf profile renderDashboard as a story” → “Once, a sluggish dashboard groaned until a hero optimized its core…”

### Mix and Match
- **What It Does**: Combines features for deeper dives—e.g., quality + security together.
- **How to Use**: Try “analyze ./src/auth with quality and security” or “improve userService for speed and tests.”
- **Why It Helps**: Tackles multiple angles in one go, saving time and brainpower.
- **Example**: “Analyze ./src/auth with quality and security” → CodeLens checks readability and XSS risks in one pass.

## Why You’ll Love It

- **Adapts to You**: Tell it “that worked” or “try harder,” and it tunes itself to your style and codebase.
- **Saves Time**: No more manual digging—CodeLens hands you insights and fixes fast.
- **Works Your Way**: Chat naturally or tweak goals (e.g., “cut latency 30%”)—it’s flexible.
- **Plays Nice with Cursor**: Load it up, chat in the sidebar, and watch it shine alongside your edits.

## Ready to Roll?

Load CodeLens into Cursor (or your fave editor), and start chatting. Toss it a curveball like “why’s my login slow?” or “secure my API”—it’ll jump in and riff with you. Got feedback? Say “that’s ace” or “nah, tweak it,” and it’ll evolve. Dive in and make your code sing!
