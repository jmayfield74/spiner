# CodeChangeWizard - Your Code Change Companion

Welcome to **CodeChangeWizard**, a handy tool that walks you through making code changes like a pro. Built to shine in editors like Cursor, it’s your guide from “I want this” to “It’s done,” keeping you sharp on impact and design every step of the way. Whether you’re adding features, fixing bugs, or refactoring, CodeChangeWizard has your back.

## What’s CodeChangeWizard For?

CodeChangeWizard is all about turning your code change ideas into reality without the chaos. It’s perfect for devs who want to:
- Nail down what they’re trying to do (feature? fix? cleanup?).
- Scope it right—no sprawling messes.
- Design it smart with solid patterns.
- Plan it out with clear steps.
- See the ripple effects before committing.
- Get proactive tips to stay ahead.

Think of it as a co-pilot that keeps your changes focused, safe, and slick—whether you’re tweaking a line or overhauling a module.

## How to Use

Getting rolling is simple:
1. **Load the Core**: Grab the Spiner core (the engine powering the wizard) and drop it into your environment—like pasting it into Cursor’s chat or script pane.
2. **Add CodeChangeWizard**: Load the `CodeChangeWizard` system file right after the core. You’ll see a kickstart message welcoming you aboard.
3. **Chat It Up**: Start talking naturally—“add a login button” or “refactor this DB call”—and let it guide you!

No complex setup—just load it in Cursor (or your editor of choice) and start chatting. It’s built for interactive workflows where you can toss ideas and refine them live.

## What Can CodeChangeWizard Do?

Here’s how CodeChangeWizard helps, with natural-language examples and why it’s a win for your coding flow.

### Figure Out What You Want
- **What It Does**: Takes your vague idea and pins down the goal—new feature, bug fix, or refactor.
- **How to Use**: Say “I want a new thing” or “fix this crash.”
- **Why It Helps**: Clarifies your intent so you’re not flailing—e.g., turns “new thing” into “add a user profile feature.”
- **Example**: “Add a feature to my app” → “Got it—new feature! What’s it do? Show user stats?”

### Nail the Requirements
- **What It Does**: Gathers what’s needed—functional (what it does) or technical (how it works)—and flags missing pieces.
- **How to Use**: Try “make login faster” or “add a button that saves.”
- **Why It Helps**: Ensures you’ve got all the bits (e.g., “Need a DB call?”) before diving in.
- **Example**: “Add a save button” → “Cool—saves what? User input? Need validation?”

### Scope It Right
- **What It Does**: Sets boundaries—estimates size and warns if it’s ballooning out of control.
- **How to Use**: Ask “refactor my auth code” or “add a small tweak.”
- **Why It Helps**: Keeps changes manageable—no accidental rewrites of the universe.
- **Example**: “Refactor auth” → “Looking medium-sized—files X/Y/Z. Creep risk in Z—tighten it?”

### Design It Smart
- **What It Does**: Checks your approach against good principles and suggests patterns (e.g., singleton, factory).
- **How to Use**: Say “design a caching layer” or “improve this loop.”
- **Why It Helps**: Makes your change clean and future-proof, not a hack.
- **Example**: “Cache DB calls” → “Solid! How about a memoization pattern here?”

### See the Impact
- **What It Does**: Predicts how your change ripples—files touched, perf shifts, risks.
- **How to Use**: Try “what happens if I tweak this API?” or “impact of adding a field.”
- **Why It Helps**: Avoids breaking stuff downstream—see the blast radius first.
- **Example**: “Add a user field” → “Hits DB X, slows Y by 10ms—check Z too?”

### Plan the Steps
- **What It Does**: Breaks it into doable tasks with dependencies and sanity checks.
- **How to Use**: Ask “plan a logout feature” or “steps to fix this bug.”
- **Why It Helps**: Gives you a clear roadmap—no “where do I start?” stress.
- **Example**: “Plan logout” → “1. Add endpoint, 2. Clear session, 3. Test redirect—deps: session lib.”

### Stay Ahead with Tips
- **What It Does**: Guesses your next move and offers timely suggestions.
- **How to Use**: Just keep chatting—“add this,” then watch it nudge you.
- **Why It Helps**: Saves brainpower—e.g., “Done with the button? Test it?”
- **Example**: “Add a login check” → “Nice—next, secure the token? Maybe a middleware?”

### Execute with Confidence
- **What It Does**: Implements the change when you green-light it, then verifies it works.
- **How to Use**: Say “go ahead with this plan” or “execute the refactor.”
- **Why It Helps**: Only moves when you’re ready, double-checks the result.
- **Example**: “Go with the cache plan” → “Done—cache added, perf up 20%. Looks good?”

## Why You’ll Love It

- **Guides You**: From fuzzy idea to finished change, it’s got a steady hand.
- **Sees the Big Picture**: Spots impacts and risks so you don’t break the world.
- **Proactive Buddy**: Suggests next steps and patterns to keep you rolling.
- **Cursor-Friendly**: Chat in the sidebar, refine live—fits your workflow.
- **Flexible Goals**: Toss in “cut DB churn 30%” and it’ll aim there.
